# StructureTensorToolbox
Structure tensor (ST) analysis toolbox for MATLAB.

The toolbox provides a collection of routines for the evaluation of orientation dispersion metrics derived from ST analysis.
It is designed for the quantification of OD from histological images of the neural tissue, as for example sagittal or coronal sections of spinal cord tissue.
