# StructureTensorToolbox
Structure tensor (ST) analysis toolbox for MATLAB.

The toolbox provides a collection of routines for the evaluation of orientation dispersion (OD) metrics via patch-wise statistical analysis of the ST-derived image orientation.
It is designed for the quantification of OD from histological images of neural tissue, as for example silver-stained sagittal or coronal sections of spinal cord specimens.
