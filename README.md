# StructureTensorToolbox
Structure tensor (ST) analysis toolbox for MATLAB.

The toolbox provides a collection of routines for the evaluation of orientation dispersion metrics derived via directional statistical analysis of ST-derived orientation indices.
It is designed for the quantification of OD from histological images of the neural tissue, as for example sagittal or coronal sections of spinal cord tissue.
